### memory_for_synonyms
Project with Melissa Meade to test false memory for synonyms and antonyms of words that have been either drawn or written. For this project it's important to ensure that a given word (e.g. a synonym of a drawn word) is not also related to other words that were learned (e.g. not also a synonym of a written word, and not also an antonym of another drawn word). The various lists (e.g. drawn words, written words) must also be matched on length and frequency. The notebook antonym_finder contains code to help analyze and organize a set of proposed words for the study.
