### memory_for_synonyms
Project with Melissa Meade to test false memory for synonyms and antonyms of words that have been either drawn or written. For this project it's important to ensure that a given word (e.g. a synonym of a drawn word) is not also related to other words that were learned (e.g. not also a synonym of a written word, and not also an antonym of another drawn word). The various lists (e.g. drawn words, written words) must also be matched on length and frequency. The notebook antonym_finder contains code to help me analyze and organize a set of proposed words for the study.

### twitter_ownership_language
Project with Shaylene Nancekivell and Ori Friedman to study the use of ownership language on Twitter.  The notebook Twitter Study Code 1 - Find and Search Hashtags contains code to check trending hashtags on Twitter over the course of a day, search for and download tweets using each of those hashtags, and automatically generate pdfs with some examples of tweets and a word clouds so that human raters can rate whether each hashtag is related to a 'cause'.
